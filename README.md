# Pirates-and-Navy-game
A simple game written in Javascript.
You use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the ship in that direction.
The map is relatively randomly generated on each play through. 
With each move you will lose a random amount of food; running out of food results in a game over.
You gain more food by visiting an island, which will subtract a random amount of gold for a proportionate amount of food.
You gain more gold by visiting the treasure chests. 
The goal is to get to your home castle without running out of food or gold, and without being eaten by the monster or drowned by the whirlpool.
